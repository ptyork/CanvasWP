# Instructure Canvas for Windows Phone 7.5/8.x

This is a Windows Phone client for accessing and interacting with the
Instructure Canvas academic course management system.

This is in a very early stage of development. Currently the web service
API is functioning and partially complete. The main app screens query
and display data as expected. However, as yet, there is very little
real utility.

## Contributing

I'm simply low on time to contribute to this project heavily. I would
certainly appreciate any help. If you would like to contribute, please
submit a pull request or two to show your C#/Silverlight/WinPhone cred,
and I'd be more than happy to add you as a contributor.
